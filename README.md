lex-query
=========

Query token structures across languages to perform the functions of an LSP server, without any "semantic" info.

# TODO
- how to describe token queries that make sense?
- how to efficiently store token indices that will allow token queries to be Pretty Fast?
- how to describe lexical grammars for languages and sublanguages?
    - how to identify the common classes of token structures, as in, to someone writing queries?
